# Python Unittest Selenium Framework

This project serves as a comprehensive guide and template for setting up a Python unittest framework for web automation. It is designed to help users understand the fundamental structure and best practices involved in creating a robust testing framework using Selenium and Python.

## Project Purpose

- **Educational Resource:** This project is intended as an educational resource for individuals looking to build a solid foundation in web automation using Python and Selenium.

- **Framework Structure:** Explore the well-organized structure of a unittest framework, including the implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) for better code maintainability.

- **Configuration Management:** Learn how to manage configuration details using a configuration file and leverage best practices for handling sensitive information.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Python unittest framework:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the project structure and understand the role of key files.
3. Explore the example Page Object Model (POM) implemented for web automation.
4. Learn how to set up and configure the framework for your own projects.

## Note

This project is primarily focused on providing a clear and educational path for setting up a Python unittest framework. It is not meant to be executed as an automation test scenario but rather as a learning resource for framework creation.

Happy coding and exploring the world of web automation with Python and Selenium!
